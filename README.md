# Dijkstra-Berlin-Bus
This project implements Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the shortest paths in the Berlin Bus Network using an adjacency list representation. It parses CSV data for bus routes and stops, processes the graph efficiently, and tracks performance metrics such as execution time and memory usage.
